still in the process
So far, we can log into our account, skip the necessary notifications, access our follower list, and view them.  
At the same time, we can navigate to the profiles of the accounts we want to follow.  

### Improvements to be made:  
- Implementing the follow process  
- Displaying the profiles to be unfollowed and performing the unfollow action  
- Updating the total follower count in the terminal as we scroll through the follower list  

Additionally, I will include detailed explanations and necessary links (such as library installations) that may be useful for the project after its completion.
